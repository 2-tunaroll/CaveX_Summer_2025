Identified Risk;Impact;Initial Likelihood;Initial Severity;Initial Risk;Mitigation Strategies;New Likelihood;New Severity;Residual Risk
University shutdown due to COVID-19.;The robotics lab cannot be accessed. Meetings cannot be conducted in person.;2;4;8;Store all relevant files and software on multiple devices. Store CaveX laptop at a group member's house.;1;4;4
Key robotics hardware is damaged.;Experimental testing with the prototype becomes impossible.;2;5;10;Key components, where reasonable, will have a replacement immediately available. Where not reasonable, a replacement will be ordered as soon as possible. Hardware will be used in accordance with the relevant specifications.;2;2;4
Laptop is lost or damaged.;Software may be lost. Project cannot proceed.;2;5;10;Backups of all relevant files and software will be stored externally to the laptop and updated at the end of the day following an update or change.;1;4;4
Robot causes human harm.;Robot electronics could cause harm or autonomous behaviour could present danger.;2;5;10;Electrical component testing with approved SET technician at the University of Adelaide. Extensive testing in a controlled environment to ensure controlled and safe autonomous movement.;1;4;4
Project objectives not completed in time for assessment.;Impact on the stakeholder's research and mapping process. Impacted project quality and representation at Ingenuity Exhibition.;3;3;9;Create detailed Gantt chart showing deadlines of major assessments as well as processes to be undertaken to fulfill deadlines. Weekly team meetings to track and monitor progess.;2;2;4
Project expenditure goes over budget.;Loss of essential funds to acquire hardware necessary to complete the project objectives.;4;3;12;Extensive research on suppliers and hardware requirements to compare prices and gain a detailed understanding of what is needed.;2;2;4
Project left incomplete.;Next year's group will have an impacted understanding of the project which will significantly lower quality.;3;3;9;Create handover documents to update next year's team of the completed work so far and what still needs to be done.;2;2;4
Robot runs out of power whilst in cave system.;Equipment loss which may not be retrievable.;3;4;12;Increase robot battery life to support extended autonomous ventures. Implement a return to deployment position command when battery life falls below minimum threshold.;1;4;4
Robot gets loss or pathfinding capability malfunctions.;Equipment loss which may not be retrievable.;2;4;8;Conserve the robots ability to be manually controlled, signal to toggle between autonomous and manual control.;1;4;4
