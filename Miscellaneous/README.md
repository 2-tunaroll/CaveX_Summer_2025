# Miscellaneous Folder
This folder contains miscellaneous files and folders. This could include anything in theory, but it is primarily intended for various config files and similar things which were used during development but aren't necessarily required to run the robot's software.

## neovim (nvim)
Neovim is a fork of Vim (text editor) which we used to do coding, change config files, etc. The ***"init.vim"*** file is run whenever a Neovim instance is launched (such as by using the "nvim" terminal command). 

This file defines the various plugins which are installed, key bindings, themes, etc for our particular preferences. If you've not used Vim or Neovim before then you will have absolutely no idea what you're doing. We're essentially assuming that future iterations of this honours project will be conducted by mech eng + comp sci double degree students due to the software-heavy part of it, so there's a good chance some or all of you are familiar with Vim/Neovim. If you're not, then it's a cool skill to have as it can be quite useful, but it'll also make you look like a wizard to bystanders.
